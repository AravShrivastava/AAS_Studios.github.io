<p style="font-size:17px">
" We are back here," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We sure are!",replied Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They got back to the parallel world, after they got hit by the truck. There were no signs of injury.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Are you fine? You almost died back there. What were you thinking?", asked Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama replied," Searching for some idiot."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" An idiot?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Searching for you!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Two at a time."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Only you idiot."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Thats rude."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" And you did no better. Saved me from the car accident then got hit by truck. Why?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Why? I saved you and I had no idea of getting hit by the truck."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Not that jerk. Why you saved me?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I saved you and you are asking me why!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No! I meant you do not involve yourself in other matters then why? Why?", she had a depressing look," Why did saved me?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi was expert at reading between the lines. He understood what she meant.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Because I owed you one. You forgot? You forget easily, about food and shelter. Now we are even. Don't go running into accidents now. I won't save you," he said with a smile.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama saw him smle for the first time," Okay! Let's get going!", she replied cheerfully. All her sadness got away. They were back to normal.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You look better now," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What should we do now?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Head back from where we got split. To the 'Sacred Valley' and meet Kayaba."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They headed to the 'Sacred Valley'. They reached the point where they got separated. They moved on further. There they found a cave. Takeshi suggested that they might be there. When they entered they found Kayaba and Shizuku. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Took you long enough!", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Sure did. What is our plan now," asked Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Hear me out every one," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" There are only four of us!", replied Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Don't mess with me!", urged Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So what you want to say?", asked Shizuku.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We need to confront Darwin!", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We all know that, tell something new," said Takeshi. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We have to confront Darwin! We have tp! For that we need some preparations. I know a perfect place where we can get some destructive items, weapons and equipments," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So what is the strategy?", asked Shizuku.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I am still thinking on it," replied Kayaba," Miss you can help me with it. I will be very grateful."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Focus on work king. Now I am getting feeling that don't deserve the throne either," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba said," So first we have to head to the border town of Veunedula. There lives my friend. We can trust him."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They all headed to this person who had destructive weapons and can provide them with useful materials. It took a day to reach there. There they saw a house alone in the wild forest. Then some one came out of it carrying a load in his hands. He saw them and said," What time has come! King having problem in getting in his own kingdom. Such a failure, Kayaba."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Matthew, I need your help!", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You have got some new friends!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yeah!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi thinking in his mind - why I am the one being count as friend.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So how can I help you?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We need weapons."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You came to the right place. I have the exact items you will surely like. No you will love them."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They all got in. There they introduced each other. " Philip Warner? But!!", Aoyama exclaimed.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yeah! My name is Philip Warner. But can call me Matthew. Feel free."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi felt like someone was staring at them. He asked," Do you live on your own all alone?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No, I live with my younger sister."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh!", Takeshi suspicions got resolved.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Matthew picked up some swords and told that they may come handy. Everyone picked one. He gave a band to each. This band on activation acts as shield. " The technology is way too advanced," said Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Now these masterpiece!", Matthew said," According to me, Kayaba should take IM07, Shizuku take IM05, Aoyama can take healer. This heals the injury quickly. It has compounds to heal and the main part is, it has a lot of catalyst."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What are IM07 and IM05 exactly?", asked Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" IM acronym for ideal machine are destructive weapons. 05 is fire type and 07 is electric type," explained Matthew.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He showed what IM can do and is capable of. He picked IM05 and hold it tight in his hands. A flame covered his hands as if his hand was burning than he punched in air and a vast area ahead burnt. He explained that these can be used with weapons also.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So powerful. It is magic, isn't it," said Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No!", replied Takeshi," It is not magic. He is right. There technology is far beyond ours. In physics, there are two types of machines on a simple basis, ideal and actual. The one we are used to is Actual machine. Ideal machine in which the machine is weightless and frictionless, and gives 100% efficiency(effort = load). We call it magic in fantasy but they achieved our fantasies."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh I see. But how fire."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" He put the effort in this IM and this machine took energy from paricles in surrounding or inter-dimensional. It also manipulated it."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Matthew said," I have these old pair of energy guns. Takeshi they may suit you. They sure are old but very effective."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Thank you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Kayaba, you look so good in your new outfit. Now we can say here is one king. That's a new sword also. It's so shiny," said Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Better than that butler like dress," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You never loose in messing with me," replied Kayaba.
</p>

<img src="../img/A13_Sterk.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title="Confronting Daring Lord.">

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So let's take him down," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They all discussed of weapons to use and to take with them. It was night so they had dinner and took rest. Shizuku and Kayaba were coming up with strategy. Matthew was dealing with his sister Hinashi, explaining about the strangers. Matthew lived alone because of his younger sister who is uncomfortable with people especially strangers. Takeshi was out in the lawn staring at stars. Aoyama joined him.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama asked him," Why don't you smile always, just like you did before. You looked happy and good."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," Happy? Happy you say. Aoyama when do you feel happy?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" When? Not any particular. I get happy when I go through a better experience or enjoy the moment."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You are some what correct. When people experience better than their normal life they get happy."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes. I said the same."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" But they have wrong mindset that they start from neutral. The truth is everyone is in pain and sadness. When they feel less sad, they say they are happy. Some are satisfied with their lives and some get depressed over it."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You think that way. That's not true. You are wrong!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Sadness is the only truth. One's life can be without happiness or angry or nervousness but never without sadness."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
I felt a little relieved before so I smiled and that too just to console you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" To console me?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You were not in good shape there."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I see. So, it was fake."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Aoyama, when do you get afraid?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I am afraid from the start when we came here. This is a nice world but I am afraid. Will I be able to return back home?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" A person gets afraid when he feels like something is going to be taken away from him."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Hmm..."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi stood up," I will make sure you get home. Don't get afraid for it," and then joined others. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama was stunned after learning some of Takeshi's thoughts on life. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Next day, during lunch Kayaba suggested strategy," We will sneak into the palace and slowly take our control over then confront Darwin. Once we have defeated Darwin, the kingdom will come under my control and the misery caused will come to an end. But that's not so easy."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Shizuku said," We have to get in the kingdom first. Hide from the soldiers. Reach the center where palace is located."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It's a hard task," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It is so difficult. I am getting nervous," said Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It sure is but we have to do this to get in the palace," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Will we be able to do it?", asked Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We will. Don't worry," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We just have to get into the palace, right. Then why to do these hard to achieve tasks. Why not do it in the easy and simple way and directly confront Darwin," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Easy way? Is there any? Shizuku and I spent a whole night to make the simplest strategy.", asked Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Ya, pretty simple," replied Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
<strong> ONE HOUR LATER... </strong>
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" How did I end up here," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So this was your simple way. To get arrested," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yeah. Now we will directly confront Darwin and without sneaking we are getting into the palace," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You are an idiot."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Shut up. Keep it down," shouted one of the knights.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They were being captured and were taken to be shown before Daring Lord. There were seven knights surrounding them.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" OK! Understood," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Everyone looked at Kayaba. With awkward stare (pity stare).
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Why are you all staring me?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," Just saw a change.King who ordered everyone is now getting an order from an ordinary soldier. You have my pity."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Don't laugh at me!", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" But no one is laughing," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
 Then Aoyama and Shizuku start laughing.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Be quiet," said the knight. They all did not say anything then. After being silent for some time, the silence reached it's limit.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What's the plan?", asked Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," We take him down."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" OK!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama was nervous and afraid. She looked at Takeshi. Takeshi consoled her with sign. She felt a little relieved.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They were on the street of Veunedula, on their way to palace.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They were directly taken to king's court. The gaurd soldiers opened the gate and there awaited for their arrival, Darwin," Long time no see; Kayaba!!"
</p>

<img src="../img/21831a3a9ff8e7a081f15d0a6c8ac25b.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title="Daring Lord, Darwin">

<p style="font-size:17px">
The four of them were standing in front of Darwin, handcuffed. Kayaba said," Your good time ends here Darwin!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh! Really! How?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We will take you down and stop you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You all, without any weapons, will take me. Let's see!" 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You are wrong, we have weapons!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Then Shizuku takes off her cloak and from the cloak she takes out all the weapons and shields. She says," My cloak is no ordinary. It is CLK-35, it has empty space like black hole. Store any amount of items, no matter their weight and size in it. But still it feels nothing. No heavy other than it's own weight."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They all break through the chains, they were bind to. They were no more handcuffed. She gives them their weapons. The soldiers attack them. Kayaba and Shizuku clear the way on the frontline. Takeshi was backup though he did not need to lift even a finger. Aoyama was their trump card, with healer. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They took all the soldiers and knights in no time. 
</p>

<img src="../img/4f1bd2250da992039fab337ef793e3c9.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title="Shizuku with her burst gun.">

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That was cool, impressive, way more than I thought. No it was badass," said Darwin.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Darwin, give up and surrender. You won't be able to win against us. It is four against one," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Darwin? Call me Daring Lord! Show some respect to your knig!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Never!", saying so Kayaba took the first attack and directly used IM07 combined with his sword makind the sword, the object of IM07. It turned out to be an electric sword. Then he striked in air from some distance to Darwin. It created an electric stroke which moved forward towards Darwin. From backup Shizuku used IM05 with her gun. The bullets turned out to be fire balls and blast. She without wasting time shot them on Darwin. Now two attacks one electric type and one fire type were approaching Darwin in no second. No room for Darwin to escape, he was badly trapped. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Baka! IM06 activate!", Darwin used water type attack to block both of their attacks. A COUNTER-ATTACK.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Water? But how he blocked Kayaba's attack?", asked Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," Pure water. Electricity has no effect on pure water. But that's not considerable. He used IM with bare hands. Remember what Matthew told."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes. He said that IM used with barehands requires great powers and potential. But Matthew also used them barehands."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Matthew has the power. And so Darwin possess. No good. It is going to be harder than I thought." 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was all smoke and fog for a while. When it was a little clear, Darwin shadow was visible in the less fog. Darwin attacked Kayaba with his sword. Kayaba blocked it but the brutal force made him hit the wall. He was hurt and half-concious. Then Darwin with enormous speed, not even a full second, reached behind Shizuku and attacked her.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So fast!!", said Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Aoyama use your healer and heal both of them," said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You are the one, if I am not wrong, who made my plan successful right. Thanks to you I was able to achieve this throne. I will give you chance to attack first," said Darwin.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," You think you are so strong. Don't regret this later."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi pointed the energy guns Matthew gave and shot them. Darwin blocked and deflected the energy beams with his sword.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So fast and quick," exclaimed Aoyama. She was using the healer to heal Kayaba and Shizuku. Darwin looked unbeatable, he was fast, swift and with great weapons.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Why are you even fighting? What are you fighting for?", asked Darwin.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," To get back to our world."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So how will it happen after defeating me? Accept it you don't have an answer. You are just going with the flow. Let me help you. This sword is no ordinary sword."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I can see that."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It is very powerful weapon if used but that is not it's true purpose. It is the key which controls and stabalizes 'Door', portal to another world. Using this I can send you and your friend back to your world. I, myself will see you off and say bye. Leave the misery of this world to itself."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama looked at Takeshi with curiosity, waiting for his answer.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi was thinking in his mind," This is the most lame, stupid reason I have to hide true intentions. No other choice."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No. Now I have a reason to fight I am not her friend," replied Takeshi. He then took both energy guns and shot simultaneously. " Why you all keep addressing me as their friend."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Darwin was still too fast and was able to dodge most of them and blocked the rest with his sword.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Takeshi! You will regret this," shouted Darwin.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I do!", said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
There the fierce battle began. Darwin with his enormous speed and sword strikes Takeshi but surprisingly for Darwin he was not able to hit him even once. Takeshi dodged all of them. Darwin attacks and Takeshi dodges, this game was too fast that in a blink of eye hundreds of attacks were striked and dodged. Darwin lost control and used all of his powers trying to knock Takeshi down. It was his biggest mistake, a flaw in battle! He ignored others. Not to forget there were more than Tkeshi. Aoyama using healer healed Kayaba and Shizuku.  
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba intrupted in between. Kayaba started sword fight with Darwin. The legendary duel began. Darwin was all stunned for a minute. Kayaba sttacked him vigorously. Kayaba did not give any chance to Darwin to think something. Darwin was only able to defend, just defending. Kayaba attacked straight on his main body but Darwin blocked it. Their swords were stuck and in the same position.  
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba applied more force but still was not able to move. Then kayaba Kayaba did his second strike and Darwin fall away.
</p>

<img src="../img/0126_006_en-us.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title=" Legendary battle - Sword Fight">

<p style="font-size:17px">
After some time Darwin was back to his senses. He stood up and said," I can never lose to the likes of you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Then he took some thing from his under lining.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Dagger!!", everyone was surprised.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Darwin threw daggers towards Kayaba. Kayaba was able to deflect both of them but no sooner did he deflect those than Darwin striked him. He used daggers as diversion. Kayaba was hurt, all in blood. He was bleeding. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi came running where Aoyama and Shizuku were standing. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi said," Aoyama use healer to heal Kayaba."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" OK! Understood!", replied Aoyama and then she was gone to heal Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Shizuku, I hate to adnit it but Kayaba was right. At present you are our only hope and light in this darkness. Do what you are here for."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Even in this situation you are picking on Kayaba. Surely  I will do what I am here for.", said Shizuku.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We will use the same trick Darwin used, diversion."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" OK"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Darwin saw Aoyama trying to use healer. " You are annoying girl. No, not again. I won't let you!" 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Darwin used his IM06 and attacked Aoyama. Takeshi blocked his overflow attack. Shizuku used her IM05 and did rapid blast fire on Darwin. Darwin with his speed dodged some, blocked some, deflected some but still he got two or three hit on him. He knocked down. Aoyama and Shizuku came near Kayaba and healed him. Takeshi came to Darwin.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Darwin said," You cannot defeat me with these cheap tricks."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I know," replied Takeshi as he took out something from his pocket.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That! Don't tell me you are...!!!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes. Now Sayonara, good bye!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama, Shizuku and Kayaba heard a voice but they had no idea from where it came. Takeshi said to them," Darwin is no more. He is dead. Looks like we went a little overboard."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What!", was their reaction.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Shizuku said," My attack was just, I attacked just to bleed and let him surrender."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba was sad and depressed. He did not want Darwin to end up like this. He could not do anything else but blame himself. Takeshi told him that he was alive after attack for some time. In that he told me to tell you that it was all for good. I except that I did wrong. Kayaba was consoled. It was all a made up by Takeshi though. Only Aoyama figured it out but she did not tell anyone.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
The kingdom was freed. Kayaba got back to his throne. Shizuku managed the rebels and political affairs.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Looks like coming straight here was not a wrong idea," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Shizuku said," Yes, we made it at last."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" But we chose to come here because the soldiers were on high alert. We never found why." asked Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba said," True! The answer is gone with Darwin now."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," The answer is simple. Darwin was searching for Matthew, or he did not want others to find Matthew. As he was the only one who could provide equipments for eliminating Darwin."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes, that's true. We can agree," said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi looked at the sky and said to himself," Win at last, huh. But I will decide when this race's last comes. I decided to continue this after my defeat and won. This phrase should be revised and edited. <strong> Only thing matters is win at last, but it's up to you when that last comes. </strong> Sad for you Darwin, you won't be able to continue this race anymore. I won!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Things were slowly getting back to normal. The misery settled for a time.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
On the next day of the battle Kayaba used Darwin's sword which was the key to stimulate the parallel world. He used it to send Takeshi and Aoyama back to their own world. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" See you!", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi replied," Hmm, soon!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They got back to their world. It was just an hour late when they left. " Just an hour passed!", exclaimed Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" But we are back," replied Takeshi," Don't tell anyone about what happened. Forget it already. Don't mention this in any case."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Understood!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
About a month passed. Everything was normal. Aoyama acted like she never experiencedsuch a thing. Takeshi sure had a little change because Aoyama would drop out every now and then. On one of these days, Takeshi felt something off while returning home. There was a wierd aura. Takeshi was nostalgic but ignored. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
When he reached home, he saw that the door's lock was open. He was on gaurd now. He opened the door and saw some one's shoes. By the time he could think of any thing a voice from his dark room came," Why only teenagers have all the fun. They get super powers, adventure and everything and become hero. No one cares about us, experienced and more reliable people. We should be the main characters."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" People like young main characters than old," said Takeshi as he walked towards the room," Dad!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" How was your journey?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It has been a long time now but though I got there after a long time. It was fine."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They were conversing without looking at each other. Takeshi's dad was in the dark. His face was hardly visible. Takeshi was near his table, Looking at some myth books and historical books.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So what kind of people you met?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Many. Two innocent and idiot kids. Shizuku, she may look cherismetic and cheerful but she is a whole lot serious. Don't go on her face. Kayaba, king of Veunedula. He literally is a royal person with his behavior. King! Matthew, he was a smart guy."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You used that to take on Darwin."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I had no choice and its not the first time I used it."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I know. There was a girl with you also."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Aoyama."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" She got to that parallel world with you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I was also amazed. Though Shizuku with her half baked knowledge and prediction saved us, me from from truth. I escaped with her theory."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That does not change the truth."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes, I am used to these inter-dimensional stuff but why she came to that world."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I really wish we old power had the lead in stories. Listen! She is no ordinary student. Keep an eye on her," he disappeared after saying so.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Talk about change of topic. You don't have to tell me any way. I kept an eye on her from the start."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Back in parallel waorld, after Takeshi and Aoyama left.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" We should head back now!", said Shizuku.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yeah!", replied Kayaba," I hope they reached safely."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" They would have."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" umm... there, what is this place. Can you tell me where I am?", a girl's voice from behind.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba looked back and was astonished after what he saw.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" YOU?!!!"
</p>
