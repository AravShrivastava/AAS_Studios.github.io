<story>

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was a beautiful day, Sun was shining bright in the sky and the weather was pleasant. People were heading to their work. It was going to be a busy day. Students of <strong> Kagaya High School </strong> entering school province. It is said that the life of students changes after going to this school.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Among all the students, one was <strong>Takeshi</strong>, a normal student with poor or it is better to say no social interactions. He always seem to be alone and dull, with no interest in worldly affairs. He was good in studies but did not waste his energy like others. That's what he called it, doing extra work for better results, instead he says waste. It was clear that he cared for none. His classmates even had a discussion that if someone needs help, he won't do it. Though it never happened before, they just made things up.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was not soon when rumor start spreading that even if someone is about to die in front of him, he won't help.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
<strong> Satoshi</strong>, one of the most active student in the class and leader of the present, announced that the school is hosting a festival in three days and every class has to represent something. "Any ideas? What should we do?", Satoshi asked. To which <strong>Yuuji</strong> replied," What about we put up an act with a story of livng in another world!" 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Satoshi said,"That is a brilliant idea. Yuuji you are most familiar with these things. Can you handle the script? I will take care of the play. We will need girl's help for costumes and props. Others can give a helping hand. Any query?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Aah! Work for three days then present it at the festival.It's too much for my shoulders to handle.", said <strong>Mei</strong>, the most talkative and active girl, good in studies and sports but careless and amateur with money and worldly game. "Well, you don't have to do it all by yourself. Others will help you.", replied Satoshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi thinking - three days for the preparations of festival. Guess I will get a lot of free time, which I can use study or taking rest at school is even better.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Satoshi came near Takeshi and asked," Will you like to help us for festival?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"I'll pass.", Takeshi replied.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Everyone was cheered up and was working full heartedly for the preparation of the festival. It was evening and everyone started to pack up their bags and left. only a few of the head members of student council stayed a little longer. Student council President, <strong> Oreki Haruto </strong>, was one of them.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi walked to his home but on his way he met a girl. He could clearly make out that the girl was wierdly dressed though she covered herself with a shawl. She was in a hurry and ran without having any conversation with Takeshi and he didn't try to have one.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
When he reached home he heard few people talking about him and describing him as EXPRESSIONLESS MAN or a person with no expressions on his face and has no feelings. "This suits me...", he complimented himself. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Next day was a rush at school. Only two days were left for preparations. Whole school was looking forward to it. Takeshi just wandered around and saw others working. Though there were preparations for festival, normal classes were not omitted. During one of these classes were a young policeman barged into the class and fired one round in the air. This caused panic among students and they started screaming but Takeshi did not move even the slightest. Then the policeman pointed the gun towards Takeshi and shot continuous rounds. It created a terific atmosphere, all students ran here and there, took cover and hid under the desks.
</p>

<img src="../img/Watch-Classroom-of-the-Elite-Season-1-Episode-1-Sub-and-Dub- copy.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title="character-Takeshi">

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi still had no sign of fright and did not move a bit. "This pisses me, you bastard!", the policeman shouted as he got mad with Takeshi's response. He then aimed at him and shot first bullet which striked his desk, second which just passed through his head. This made others in a state of shock and astonishment. Takeshi looked around and glanced at the scenario created. After looking at so many frightened faces he picked up his bag and moved. "Hey! Who do you think you are fooling! What's up with that expression and look?", the young policeman shouted. Takeshi walked towards him and then stood still for about a minute in front of him. It was silence. He then said," You are too young to be a policeman. Rest I will leave to the official police.", and then moved. Soon police surrounded the campus and inquired everything. The false policeman, however, already escaped.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Due to this incident the festival was postponed for a period of time and there were chances that it may get cancelled.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Satoshi cheer up! Don't be so dull.", said Mei. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"It all went in vain, and I only suffered the pain.", said Satoshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Hai, hai! Now are you going to write a poetry? Using rhymes in sentences.", said Mei.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"It is no time to joke!", cried Satoshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I heard that the school is going to host the festival a week later. It is good for you all that you can make it in time. Don't put up a crying face, boys especially you don't look good with it.", a voice from the back.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They turned towards the voice and saw it was Takeshi leaning to the wall. They got scared but had no idea of what are they afraid of. He left from there. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Hey, Satoshi! What do you think Takeshi is like?", asked Mei.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"No idea but it looked like he was aware of the incident otherwise he could not be so calm."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi's schedule was as usual and there was no change in his behaviour but there was an uneasy and unpleasant atmosphere in the surrounding. Students were afraid but they didn't have the answer why.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Everyone was back on work. Takeshi sat under a tree from where he could see almost every class working from there. He noticed the girl from before but she was in school uniform. He said to himself," Ahh! Good she is well dressed today, but who is she? I never noticed her before."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was very rare of Takeshi to think on these  matter. He felt curious so he walked to her and asked," What's your name? Who are you?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Everyone looked at him."A... mm...umm...", she could not understand the situation and was unable to answer. "Sorry! My bad. It's my fault. It was so sudden but I just wanted to know answers of these two questions. I was kind of curious when I saw you here today." His tone was not friendly as he had no experience in it. Though the words he used needed a huge amount of expressions. It just was equilibrium, no ups and downs and no change in style.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Aoyama..., <strong>Aoyama Shiina</strong>.", she replied without thinking much. Hearing this, Takeshi left. 
</p>

<img src="../img/e54b189989adb64337ed16c5d790a4a6.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title="character-Aoyama">

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was no soon when the thought of unusual incidents occuring in school in which both, relate Takeshi started discussion among students. But it was not given much importance because of festival. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Student Council President Oreki Haruto announced," Today, we start with our school festival."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
The festival was like a hub of creativity. Different clubs depicted their culture very deeply. It was excitement in everyone which made it more lively. But this excitement didn't last for so long. The 'Golden Crown' was found stolen. It was the main and the most important item which was a crown, placed in a position where everyone can view it and given to the best performance in the festival as a reward. This created panic among student council. <strong> Ruka </strong>, the vice president told the members to keep this information a secret and students should not be aware of the incident, while they search for the culprit and the crown. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi though not having much interest in worldly affairs noticed something wierd. He was good at reading the situation. As being alone and a loner he could read between the lines easily.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He understood that something was there which wearies student council. They were in rush, moving faster than normal, keeping distance and had a different pace.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi because of his least interest in worldly worries walked on his way. It was about an hour. He saw a bunch of students surrounding and looking to the scene. When he reached there, he saw vice-president Ruka with Aoyama. It looked a very serious matter. They quietly left the place and went to a private place. The crowd dispersed, but Takeshi knew it had something to do with the earlier incident. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi secretly eavesdropped to the conversation. He heard someone crying which he guesses to be Aoyama. He could hear somesort of inquiry taking place. After half-an-hour they left.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi followed Aoyama and after looking for the best chance reached her and asked about the matter. "What are you talking about?, asked Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"I know that it was an inquiry, but I have no idea about what exactly.", said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Why are you so into it? You are not the one to look into others matters."  
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"I don't have an exact answer, but this may satisfy you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"What?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I look into every matter but all of them are easy to trace, but this time I am not sure of the conclusion."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"That's the best excuse you have got. Such a lame one."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You can say self-satisfaction. Will you tell me what happened back there?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama explained - I am a part of treasure game event management. Lucy one of my friends asked me to hide the clue somewhere in the bushes and trees behind the main ground. I first thought that it would be easy to trace as any one could see the ground and hiding something near it would be easily perceived. Then she explained that because of open ground it is easy to find something in the bushes but because it is too easy so no one will pay much attention to it. Hiding somewhere cleverly and creating a blindspot is what players will think but leave a bigger blindspot open which they don't see. But make sure you hide it carefully and in the best place.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
I was convinced so I got to the ground and when there was no one watching, I reached to boundary on the path surrounding the ground and searched for a place to hide the clue. While I was doing so, student council vice-president, Ruka saw me suspicious and got me. Then few members searched the surroundings. They came up with the 'Golden Crown' and took me as culprit.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Did you explained them that you were not the one who did it?", asked Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Of course! I did explain them."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Lucy asked you to do so, may be she did it on purpose."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I don't think she will such thing."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So you haven't told them that you were asked to do so by Lucy." 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I regret it but I told them."
</p> 

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi understood the matter. Lucy stole the 'Golden Crown' and then hid it in the bush which she says to be the bigget open blindspot. Then she asked Aoyama to hide the clues somewhere there so that Aoyama gets suspicious, and Ruka caught her red handed.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi asked," Do you have any issues, or some issues are there between you two which made her to make you suspicious?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No! I told you she will never do such a thing.", replied Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh! I see."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He was sure that student council had two theories, one with Aoyama being culprit, the another with Lucy being suspect and Aoyama as victim.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Next day, Lucy was inquired about the incident. This incident was kept a secret from students and was not seriously looked into by the council till the festival ended. 
</p>

</div>

<div id="divright">
</div>

<p style="font-size:17px">
The very next day when the festival ended,<strong> Kayaba</strong>, the best detective so called looked into the case. Though being a show off, was smart and very friendly frank but he was just popular. He did not have any to trust him or be friends with except Darwin, his only friend.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"With all the information, inquiry and proof, we arrive to this conclusion - Lucy stole the crown and then hid it in the bushes. She asked Aoyama later, to go there somewhere to hide the clues so that she may be blamed. This is the simple conclusion.", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That's the conclusion everyone has got. Lucy, you thought you can trick us but failed.", said Ruka.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Lucy said," No! I ..."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" There is one more possibility.", said Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Ruka asked," And what that may be?"
</p> 

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Aoyama, I heard that you got humiliated before the festival started and also said that it would be the best if the festival gets cancelled?", asked Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama replied," Yes, but because..."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba continued," It is possible that Aoyama stole the crown and hid it in the bushes. But looking at the situation you needed to escape being culprit and needed an opportunity, which you get when Lucy asked you to hide clues. Call it co-incidence or luck but you escaped."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That's not..., true!", cried Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
After two days of more inquiry the student council decided to suspend both of them for a week or so. They just needed to take the judgement to the teacher and its done. Kayaba handled that duty. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
When Kayaba went to the staff room he explained that the case was closed and they were unable to find culprit. Both Aoyama and Lucy are safe. This was then circulated to whole scool. The students were unaware of the incident so it was news to them.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
When Kayaba was returning from the staff room, he saw Ruka standing in the corridor. Ruka was very angry at him and asked," Why did you tell that they were safe? What were you thinking?" 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba was unable to explain. Then an unexpexted guest, Takeshi, entered and said,<strong>" If everyone is against you, it's not always that you are wrong but the fact is you were different from others. Your opinion was different and they are jealous of you so they just discard you."</strong>  
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What does that mean?", asked Ruka.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Nothing! I just wanted to say it. Then, bye.", said Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Nothing! What nonsense?", shoutede Ruka.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba said," May be he was just talking about himself. No one likes him but neither anyone dislikes him. His presence does not make much sense or difference."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
After school, Aoyama searched for Takeshi. She saw him on his way to home. She came there and asked," What did you do?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What? Why are you following me?", replied Takeshi.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" How did it? What did... when... how..."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I can understand nothing."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What did you do that made us out of it,"
</p> 

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I have no idea what are you talking about."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I know it. It was your doing."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I just did it for myself, I have no interest in interfering matters."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Now, speak up all out."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Ahh! Looks like you will not leave me untill I tell you."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Correct!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You really are a pain."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Now tell everything."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi explained - Kayaba concluded two theories and both were superficial. They answered the question 'how?' but missed very important figure. They do not tell us 'why?' this was done and 'what?' you gained. Though in your case he put up that you were humiliated so it answers 'why' but still was not so deep. I looked into it for a while then made a deal with Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Made a deal!", exclaimed Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He continued," The thief was Darwin, Kayaba's close friend. He stole the crown, placed it in the bushes."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" So, he got lucky when we decided to hide clues over there."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Nope. It was his doing. Darwin is one of the member of management in your game. He asked Lucy to hide the clues in the biggest blind spot of all. He was sure enough that Lucy will think of the place near ground."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh! Well, it is not first time. Lucy always name places."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" There he got his advantage and got out of the scene. The left was Lucy who asked you to hide the clues. You both ended up in trouble."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Haah! Then what about 'why?' and 'what?' in this conclusion."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Darwin was surely insulted a few times by Lucy and his popularity was not so well. This made him hate both. Festival was a great chance for him. As far as 'what?' is concerned, he got self satisfaction and revenge by ruining festival and using Lucy as bait."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Amazing! You did that to protect us."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No. Like I said, I made a deal. Kayaba will take care of my lunch for a week and I will not open this fact. And I had Darwin admitting his fault also."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I would have given a monthlunch to you if you told that he was behind this."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Really!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Next day during lunch Takeshi got to the ground in everyone's attention. Arranged a mike and said in a plain voice as usual without much expression," The case of 'Golden Crown' was closed. This was because the guilty was Darwin, Kayaba's friend and Kayaba protected his friend. I got a week lunch for shutting my mouth and not telling this to anyone. Kayab rest assure I will not tell anyone that you were going to give me a week's lunch to hide this from others."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Everyone started gossiping. Teachers asked student council about it. Ruka was herself unable to understand. Oreki Haruto was disappointed and appologized the teachers. Kayaba and Darwin were taken in for inspection and inquiry. Takeshi walked by Aoyama and spoke," You have to prepare a month lunch.", and then walked away. 
</p>

<img src="../img/12-kiyotaka-ayanokoji-classroom-of-the-elite.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" title=" Takeshi-"Prepare a month lunch now."">

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama got astonished and was thinking did he really do this for lunch or he is kind or may be he is doing the rightful. However, nothing was wrong.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kayaba lost his fame but Darwin was not so affected. Darwin was disliked before also and not much change now. Both were executed but the punishment only affected Kayaba.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Winter holidays were approaching. The incident was long back forgotten by students. Aoyama from then started to stick with Takeshi though he never gave response after his month of free lunch was over. The most suffered was Kayaba. Everything for him changed. Takeshi felt like Darwin fell into his trap. He tried to hurt Lucy but ended up with Kayaba his own friend.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
On one of his day on his way back home, Takeshi saw some people gathered around two. They all were over mostly old. The two were playing chess. He stood there and watched them play. It was very lively, people were cheering. Takeshi looked into the game and understood that the game was one sided. One of the player was losing every piece. The game went a little longer and then one player wins.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi was shocked. This player who lost his almost every piece with last step won. Then the old man who won said," Hey kid! Don't think much into it. The answer is simple don't care of what situation you are now, what are you losing now but all you have to do is win at last."
</p>

<div id="divright">
<img src="../img/86f18a21df38a8f7865b10bcf036833fc8be19d7_00.jpeg" title="result matters to others who don't care but effort for those who care.">
</div>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi got another way of looking and yet another perspective to observe something. He clicked something. Something just hit his head and he deeply looked into the matter. "Win at last! Ahh!", he said. Next day in school he asked everyone about Kayaba and Darwin relationship. It was a out of nowhere question from someone who did not take interest in social matters. Studets were amazed. He got to know that there was not much clear friendship as they may talk about. he drove to the conclusion of the mystery.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He sat under a tree and looked very serious. Aoyama saw him and came near and asked," What's up with that tense look and scary face? Are you worried about something?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He looked at the starry sky and said," I finally, at last got involved in it."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"In what?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Darwin won. The reality was so near that we didn't even notice it."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Now I am getting nothing. Can't you explain things simpler. You always speak quotes like they are some codes. I will have to learn how to decode your stuff for understanding it. And from where this Darwin pop out?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Darwin and Kayaba became friends in middle school. When they entered high school Kayaba attracted many because of his frank nature and on the other hand he was smart. Darwin felt jeolous of Kayaba as he got to be the one who was famous. Kayaba sure got popularity but could not gain trust as he always thought of Darwin in first place. Darwin did not understand this about Kayaba. All Darwin needed was to rip apart all that Kayaba got. He used Lucy as decoy. He knew that this will surely be caught and if he had luck the person who solved it would deal the detective 'Kayaba' or more specifically if Kayaba himself discovered the truth of the act. Kayaba will hide it to save his friend. I played that role. In the end, Kayaba was the one who got hurt and suffered. Darwin was aware that this act of Kayaba will no sooner be public."

" Oh! I see."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Damn. Darwin still doesn't understand that Kayaba trusted him so much. He respected him."

For the first time Aoyama saw Takeshi angry and crying for being played in such an act. She kind of understood why Takeshi kept a distance from others, to not get involved.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
She said," It has been months to that incident."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He replied,<strong>" The people who agree with you even on your worst lies are not fools, it means that they trust you and even knowing that you are lying ignore it. They will support you. Remember these words."</strong>
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" The people... agree... fools. Ahh! I don't understand your codes."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Takeshi washed his face and was back to normal.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Aoyama asked," Aren't you going to tell everyone about the truth."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It doesn't matter now. <strong> The words loose their importance if spoken on wrong time and situation.</strong> It's same same as speaking Russian in a Hindi speaking comunity or Japanese in english.", was his reply and went saying so.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
"Code again. I think after speaking to him I will be the best decoder.", said Aoyama.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
New year a new start is what they say. This became reality for Takeshi. Opening his eyes in to an another world.
