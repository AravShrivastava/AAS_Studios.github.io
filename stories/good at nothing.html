<p style="font-size:17px">
<strong> Otashi Amagiri</strong>, a teenage boy in high school, walking to school. This story is about him and it is not a normal one because he possessed something which is not ordinary. On his way to school, he saw Maria and Kirin. " Good morning, long time no see," said Amagiri," On your way to school I suppose."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Maria replied," Good morning, we are on our way to school."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kirin asked," Would you like to join us?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" If you don't mind I would like to join you all too!", someone from the back shouted.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They turned back and saw he was Daigo.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh I see, someone is speaking formally! You have learnt to respect others and you may join us," said Kirin to Daigo.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Daigo when did you returned from overseas?" asked Amagiri.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Daigo replied," Yesterday and without resting I came to see you all."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They reached school and had usual schedule.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I am having a concert tomorrow evening, well, it is a competition, so I just wanted to ask you. Will you all like to come and chher me on?", said Maria.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Fine, we will surely be there."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was soon when the musical competition started. Many participants played very beautifully, some where nervous and a few were just ordinary. Mario performed very nicely and it was soon time for results. All participants were in restroom. One of them started acting violently. He was Saka Smith.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Hey! You have got some nice techniques, better if you leave. You won't be able to stand a chance in this big world. I am just advising you now for your good. I am the best!", said Smith.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Smith! Don't be reckless. Better if you leave him, and you have got some good style but you can never be a fair musician." Maria shouted.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You have got some guts I see."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Better if you leave him."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" OK! You say I play unfair so lets settle this at once."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" How do you think you are doing that?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I'll bully instead of him."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No way you are getting your hands on her," Amagiri said.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Fine, lets find with a challenge than. If you played better than me, Amagiri, I will never show my face again but if I win your friends will serve me," Smith said.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Kirin said," You don't have to go through this." 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Amagiri replied," It's fine, let's settle this at once."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They challenged each other and Smith played first. His music was beautiful as expected of him. Now, it was Amagiri's turn. It was like unexpected but he played insanely, no one was even near to him. As a result, he won the challenge but asked Smith to befriends. Smith however, rejected the offer out of shame.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Everyone asked him about it that how he was able to play so good. He just mentions that it just happened. Time passed, it was soon art festival and all the friends gathered. Many artists were present and each one of them was painting or drawing respectively. They also started to try something though, not bad, everyone was able to come up with something. Amagiri surprisingly painted a beautiful scenery. The crowd came to take a glance of it.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You never told us, you were too good at painting!", exclaimed Kirin.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh! It was nothing for me.", Amagiri replied.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Daigo said," You played piano and guitar last time so well and now in arts. May be you have got some magical spell."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No way!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Maria started doubting Amagiri. He started doing excellent in every field or more than that.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Hey Amagiri! Would you like to go out with me this evening?", asked Maria.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Fine with me," Amagiri replied.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They went through shopping district, malls and cafe. They had a nice time and enjoyed.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Maria said," I would like to ask you something, or rather like a answer from you..."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Go on."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" How did you do that?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What exactly?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Everything! So professionally."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh! So you figured something fishy. Want to know the truth?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Amagiri explained - I was on my morning walk and I saw a shining star and it was speaking to me and gave me powers.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That's stupid!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I was just kidding."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I would like to hear truth."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Hmm.."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Amagiri explained seriously - My power is a maybe a gift I suppose. Whatever I do it is done like what I imagine, just like professional's finishing. I don't remember how long I had these powers and how I got these but I use them mostly now.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You are using your powers for your self gains. I see, ruining hard work of people who came for their dreams to come true."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" No, I didn't mean that."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" But you did that, you do that always."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" How?"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" These competitions means nothing to you, just means of funand popularity, but there are many whose life has nothing other than those competitions, its there life, and you discourage them."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" That's harsh, they should work hard and not get discourage over these matters..."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You never worked hard, you are nothing without them."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Oh really!"
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
They quarelled and left. Otashi thought about it through. He saw a news that an excellent scholar commited suicide just because he didn't win art competition. He felt guilty. It was not soon he lost his powers and got degraded. He was just thinking only one thing, just a few important words - GOOD AT NOTHING.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
That was the moment his life got changed got changed, he had a motive now to work hard to of something. It took him seven years of hard work and dedication to excel in music.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He played beautiflly at a concert. There as viewers were present a large crowd, also, Maria, Kirin and Daigo. When it ended, he made a announcement that it was his first and last concert," but I will help others to fulfil their dreams."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
He wanted to apologized Maria about before but was unable to. Gathering some strength and courage he apologized her.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
It was all even now. They were happy with their lives and devoted themself to help others.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You know what, your powers are your part. You can use them for your use," said Maria.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" What! But back then you said."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" I know what I said. I had to. You were not being yourself, so I pulled out that act."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" It means."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yes, it is all fine to use powers. Now after I said all that you have become a whole better person now."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Huh! Then may be it is not useless."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" You really are good at nothing."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
" Yeah."
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Many months passed and they had much better lives. Then one day Amagiri realized that he got his powers back with some new. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Amagiri said to himself," Well I have no idea how it works but it is interesting. Now there is going to be some fun. The story has just begun. Now is where interesting part starts..."
